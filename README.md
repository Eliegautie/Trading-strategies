## Algorithmic trading courses

- For almost a year, I have been working on developing my coding and data analysis skills in close collaboration with the two founders of Profitview Richard Hickling and Jahan Zahid (https://profitview.net/). After several months of training, taking courses on Codecademy, testing my skills on Codility, and building the premise of a Bitcoin trading algo (working with Jahan), I now have a decent level of programming.


- Since March, Profitview has launched a series of webinars in which participants, supervised by Jahan, backtest and deploy an algorithmic trading strategy in a live environment. These webinars are the beginnings of an algorithmic trading course that should start soon, where we will work on building an effective algorithmic trading program. You can find the work done so far in these webinars here: https://github.com/profitviews/workshops. 


- In addition to taking these courses, I also subscribed to the algorithmic trading platform Profitview (Hobbyist), which allows me to get live data from different exchanges and build my algorithm more easily. You can see the basics of the ProfitView Trading Bots tab here:

- In this repository, my goal is to develop and backtest trading strategies, which I could then propose during workshops before implementing them in a real environment with ProfitView Trading bot.
