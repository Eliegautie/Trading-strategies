**1/ Bollinger Bands**

There are three bands of this indicator :

- The mid band is the moving average on the price series (usually takes **20** lags). 
- The upper and lower bands are **two** moving standard deviations away from the mid band. 
 
Bollinger Bands can be used to test for various types of strategies :

- For *volatility trading*, contraction and expansion of the band width are crucial elements. Any distinct momentum clustering (it can take form of either upward or downward) would result in a Bollinger Bands expansion. And the oscillation in a horizontal channel would result in a Bollinger Bands contraction.

- For *momentum trading*, the phenomenon of 'walking the band' indicates the resistance and support level of the underlying asset. In a strong trend, the price constantly attempts to touch or break through the upper/lower band along with Bollinger Bands moving towards the same direction.
