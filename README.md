# Bollinger Bands - short introduction

Bollinger Bands consist of :
- an N-period moving average (MA), 
- an upper band at K times an N-period standard deviation above the moving average (MA + Kσ), 
- and a lower band at K times an N-period standard deviation below the moving average (MA − Kσ).

Typical values for N and K are **20** days and **2**, respectively.
